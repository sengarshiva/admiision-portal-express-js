                    By studying with us, you will gain an in-depth understanding of British society and culture by living and studying alongside British students, and you will be able to experience London, one of the world's great capital cities.
                    
                    We work hard to ensure that Study Abroad and Erasmus+ students are well-supported before, during and after their studies and are integrated into the Greenwich community as soon as they arrive. Additionally, students can choose to live in on-campus accommodation at one of the three campuses providing you with a great way to meet new friends during your stay with us.
                    
                    If you're looking for an ideal location to study abroad, stimulating academic courses, and a chance to experience London, the best city in the world for university students, get in touch today!</p>
